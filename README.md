## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'parliament'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install parliament
```

**Note**: If you use turbolinks, this should be placed _after_ loading turbolinks.

In your application.js:

```javascript
//= require parliament
```
## Usage

Given a simple application with Tasks belonging to Projects, the first thing to do is allow your Project model to accepts_nested_attributes_for.

**Models**

```ruby
# app/models/project.rb
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :tasks, inverse_of: :project
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :tasks, reject_if: :all_blank, allow_destroy: true
end

# app/models/task.rb
class Task < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :project
end
```

Because Rails 5 and above belongs_to associations are required by default, we must specify the link with `inverse_of` because the child object(tasks) cannot be saved until the parent (a project) is saved.

Moving on, we'll need to add the parameters to the controller.
- `id` and `_destroy` are required for Strong Params.

**Controller**

```ruby
# Projects Controller
# app/controllers/projects_controller.rb

private

def project_params
  params.require(:project).permit(:name, :description, tasks_attributes: [:id, :description, :done, :_destroy])
end
```

**Form**

Inside the Project form, add a `fields_for` loop that will pass the `task` to the `task_fields` partial for adding or updating.

**projects/_form.html.erb**
```erb
# Rest of file omitted
<div class="form-group">
  <%= f.label(:tasks) %>

  <%= f.fields_for :tasks do |task| %>
    <%= render 'task_fields', f: task %>
  <% end %>

  <%= f.add_association 'Add Task',
    'tasks',
    class: 'btn btn-secondary btn-sm' %>
</div>

# Rest of file omitted
```

Additionally, we call `f.add_association`, a form builder method, which generates a link with data attributes that Parliament's javascript will call to insert another field. While other gems like Cocoon take a global approach with a helper, this scopes things to forms so they are not globally available.

**_task_fields.html.erb**
```erb
<div class="nested-fields mb-1">
    <div class="input-group">
      <%= f.text_field :description, class: "form-control" %>

      <%= f.check_box :done %>
      <%= f.label :done %>

      <span class="input-group-append">
        <%= f.remove_association 'Remove', { class: 'btn btn-outline-danger' } %>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The two important bits here are the `.nested-fields` class added to the parent element, and the `f.remove_association` form builder link we provide, this communicates with the Javascript so that it removes the proper element if the user clicks the remove button.
